This project is a Credit Risk Assessment system that predicts the probability of a loan applicant defaulting using:
Random Forest Classifier
Bayesian Updating for risk refinement
Interactive Streamlit Web App for user-friendly prediction

Problem Statement
In the financial sector, it's critical to assess whether a borrower will default on a loan. Lenders often rely on historical data to make decisions. This project uses statistical and machine learning techniques to predict default risk and provides an interactive tool to assess it in real-time.

Key Features
Machine Learning Model trained on LendingClub dataset (2007–2018)
Monthly Time-Series Analysis using ARIMA to observe default trends
Bayesian Risk Updating — adjusts risk based on missed EMI feedback
Streamlit Web App with user input form to predict:
🔵 Prior Risk (model-based)
🟠 Updated Risk (Bayesian-adjusted)
Deployed on Streamlit Cloud with modern UI

Dataset
Source: LendingClub Accepted Loans 2007–2018Q4 (Kaggle)
Data Size: ~2.2 million records
Target Variable: loan_status → Converted to binary (Fully Paid = 0, Charged Off = 1)

Model Overview
Model Used: RandomForestClassifier

Selected Features:
Loan amount, term, interest rate, grade, employment length, home ownership.
Annual income, loan purpose, DTI, delinquencies, open accounts, credit utilization.

Risk Update:
Prior risk: Direct output from Random Forest
Updated risk: Applies Bayes' Theorem using prior + EMI status

Deploying on Streamlit Cloud
