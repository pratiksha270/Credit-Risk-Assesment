Credit Risk Assessment using Machine Learning & Bayesian Updating
This project demonstrates an end-to-end solution to predict loan default risk using machine learning, enhanced with Bayesian inference to dynamically update risk based on borrower behavior. The tool is designed to assist financial institutions in making data-driven lending decisions.

Project Summary
Objective: Predict likelihood of loan default and adjust risk based on EMI behavior.

Approach
Built a Random Forest Classifier using LendingClub data to estimate initial default probability.
Integrated Bayesâ€™ Theorem to update risk dynamically when a borrower misses an EMI.

Deployment
Developed and deployed a fully interactive Streamlit web app for real-time user input and prediction output.

Tools & Technologies
Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, joblib, Streamlit, GitHub

Achievements
Delivered a functional credit risk model deployable as a web app.
Implemented real-world credit features like term, grade, employment history, purpose of loan, etc.
Gained hands-on experience in building production-ready ML pipelines and communicating predictive results through intuitive UI.
